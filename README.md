# Algebra-And-Geometry
A collection of seminar assignments completed for a multivariable calculus course I took at KTH. I believe these assignments provide a good sample of how I tackle concrete math problems in regards to algebra and geometry _(gaussian elimination, vector geometry with dot product and vector product, determinants, vector spaces, linear independence, bases, change of basis, linear transformations, the least-squares method, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, quadratic forms, orthogonality, inner-product space, Gram-Schmidt's method and so forth)_, feel free to have a look.
